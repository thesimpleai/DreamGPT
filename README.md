# DreamGPT

DreamGPT is an innovative project that aims to enhance the creative potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) by simulating a dreaming process, unlocking new levels of innovation and creativity in AI systems.

## How DreamGPT Works

DreamGPT is designed to simulate a dreaming process for LLMs, allowing them to explore information in a more chaotic and experimental way. This process consists of two main phases: consciousness and dreaming.

### Awake- Learning/ Self-Dialogue

1. **Problem/Topic Selection:** The user decides on a problem or topic.
2. **Information Search:** DreamGPT searches Google for relevant information to further define the problem or topic and gather up-to-date information.
3. **Memory Storage:** All the gathered information is saved in Memory.
4. **Debate:** Three AI agents (Id, Ego, and Superego) engage in a debate on the problem or topic, using both their LLM training and the new information stored in Memory.

### Dreaming

5. **Memory Rearrangement:** The information in Memory is broken down and randomly rearranged.
6. **Pattern Recognition:** The rearranged information is fed back into the LLM to identify potential patterns.
7. **Insight Generation:** Patterns are stored as Insights.


### Subliminal Perception
8. **Insight Evaluation:** Insights are inputted and rated based on whether they solve the problem or provide new perspectives on the topic. If the insights are satisfactory, they will be saved in a file.
9. **Endless Dreaming: User can choose to let the LLM keep running and innovating indefinately. In this mode, useful insights will be added to Memeory before starting step 1 again.
By simulating a dreaming process, DreamGPT enables LLMs to think outside the box and generate creative solutions or ideas that are not possible with traditional rational thinking methods.
