# DreamGPT

DreamGPT is an innovative project that aims to enhance the creative potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) by simulating a dreaming process, unlocking new levels of innovation and creativity in AI systems. 
***This is an early stage experiment, the creator does not have coding background, so you might encounter some bugs when you run it.***


## How DreamGPT Works

DreamGPT is designed to simulate a dreaming process for LLMs, allowing them to explore information in a more chaotic and experimental way. This process consists of two main phases: consciousness and dreaming.

### Awake- Learning/ Self-Dialogue

1. **Problem/Topic Selection:** The user decides on a problem or topic.
2. **Information Search:** DreamGPT searches Google for relevant information to further define the problem or topic and gather up-to-date information.
3. **Debate:** Three AI agents (Id, Ego, and Superego) engage in a debate on the problem or topic, using both their LLM training and the new information from search.
4. **Memory Storage:** All the gathered information and conversations are saved in Memory.


### Dreaming- Randmoize information

5. **Memory Rearrangement:** The information in Memory is broken down and randomly rearranged.
6. **Free Association:** Makes free assocaition with words that are relevnat to the texts in Memory.
7. **Creating Story:** Texts stored in Memory are used to generate stories
8. **Pattern Recognition:** The rearranged information is fed back into the LLM to identify potential patterns.
9. **Insight Generation:** Patterns are stored as Insights.


### Subliminal Perception- Seek patterns
10. **Insight Evaluation:** Insights are inputted and rated based on whether they solve the problem or provide new perspectives on the topic. If the insights are satisfactory, they will be saved in a file.
11. **Endless Dreaming: User can choose to let the LLM keep running and innovating indefinately. In this mode, useful insights will be added to Memeory before starting step 1 again.
By simulating a dreaming process, DreamGPT enables LLMs to think outside the box and generate creative solutions or ideas that are not possible with traditional rational thinking methods.
